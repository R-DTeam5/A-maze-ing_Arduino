## 2 Features

- Uses UART to communicate with a PC or an external Bluetooth module
- Takes IMU Measurements
- Handles interrupts from knock sensors
- Uses I2C to connect with an external IO expander
- A variable delay between measurements

### 2.1 UART
The Arduino uses UART to communicate with a computer and an external Bluetooth module ([HC-05][HC-05]).
The data transmitted is a string formatted as shown:
> `i`,`value1`,`value2`

where:
- `i` : The unique identifier of the type of command
- `value1` and `value2` : A number of variables like e.g. data or variables for a funciton
- , : all values are separated with a comma

### 2.2 IMU
The Arduino measures the deta from the accelerometer and gyroscope using the [internal IMU][IMU]. This data gets send to the pc in the following format:
> i,`acceleroX`,`acceleroY`,`acceleroZ`,`gyroX`,`gyroY`,`gyroZ`
(all variables are floats)

Both the modules have a sample rate of 119Hz.

### 2.3 Knock Sensors
The Arduino handles the interrupts generated on the digital pins by a piÃ«zo electric element. When an interrupt occurs, this gets communicated with the pc in the following format:
> k,`direction`
(direction is a string)

where direction can have the following values, depending on what side of the box gets hit:
- front
- back
- left
- right
- top
- bottom

### 2.4 IO Expanders
The arduino can connect with three IO Expanders ( [SX1509][SX1509] ). The pins of the IO Expander can be manipulated by sending a command in the following format to the Arduino:
>w,`board`,`pin`,`value`
(all variables are integers)

where:
- board : a value between 1 and 3 corresponting with which of the three IO Expanders should be used:

| Board | Address |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | 0x3E |
| 2 | 0x3F |
| 3 | 0x70 |

- pin : the pin on the IO Expander PCB that should be changed, ranging between 0 and 15.
- value : the pwm duty cycle that the pin should get, ranging between 0 and 255.

### 2.5 Delay
The delay between the measurements can be altered by sending a command in the following format to the Arduino:
>d,`delay`
(delay is an unsinged long)

Where delay is the time in milliseconds between measurements.
